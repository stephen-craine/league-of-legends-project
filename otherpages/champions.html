        <p class="dropdown-content">
          Ahri is a mage who specialises in charming her opponents in order to land her burst damage. Highly mobile with decent damage per second, excellent at roaming around the map.

        <p class="dropdown-content">
          Annie is a burst mage who is exceedingly simple but effective at what she does. Her burst is mostly as an area of effect making her an excellent teamfight champion.

        <p class="dropdown-content">
          Akali can build differently but normally functions as an assassin, with high burst and if she gets kills or assists can easily snowball teamfights in her favour.

        <p class="dropdown-content">
        Anivia is a control mage who specialises in area of effect crowd control spells, altering the terrain in her favour. She is immobile so very susceptible to ganks, but she excels in teamfights.

        <p class="dropdown-content">
          Azir is not a burst mage, but rather a consistent damage per second champion. He uses soldiers rather than himself to do all his damage, which requires a very high skill to position effectively.

        <p class="dropdown-content">
          Brand is similar to Annie but his abilities are mostly skill shots, which means that he does slightly higher damage but requires more skill and better positioning to play well.

        <p class="dropdown-content">
          Cho'gath is a front line tank but he can also deal high damage to squishy targets due to his health scaling ultimate that deals true damage. Easy to play, hard to master, but very strong in the current meta.

        <p class="dropdown-content">
          Evelynn has been recently reworked. She functions as a high burst damage assassin who is camouflaged most of the time which means her mid game is exceptionally strong.
