    League of Legends is a <abbr title="Multiplayer Online Battle Arena"> MOBA</abbr> featuring up to ten people in a game. With a steep learning curve, there are plenty of tutorials for beginners interested in picking it up. It is a free to play game, with some unlocks such as champions also free if enough time is put into the game. However in-game cosmetics called 'skins' are mainly paid (but can be acquired through random 'loot' drops over time).
  </p>
  <p>
    In <abbr title="League of Legends">LoL</abbr> players assume the roles of champions whose purpose along with their team is to ultimately destroy the enemy nexus, which wins the game. However to do this, players must fight against enemy champions, neutral monsters, enemy minions and destroy enemy turrets and inhibitors.<em> See the link at the bottom of the page for more in depth information. </em>

<h2>
  <strong>LoL Game maps</strong>
</h2>
<article class="aboutwrapper">

  <h4>Summoner's Rift</h4>
  <p> 
    Summoner's rift is the main map on which all professional play is seen. It involves a 5-player versus 5-player setup, within which are normally 5 set roles. The roles normally followed in the <abbr title="currrent popular trend">meta</abbr> are as follows: Top, Mid, Jungle, <abbr title="Attack Damage Carry">ADC</abbr> and Support. The map consists of three lanes. Minions which are neutral walk down these lanes and if left uninhibited will fight opposing lane minions. One champion, controlled by a player, will fight in top and mid lane. The ADC and support normally start in the bottom lane. Plus the jungler will spend most of the early game in the jungle fighting neutral monsters (which give buffs). Playstyle and pace is normally set by the jungler in the early game then the support later on. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    There are many neutral objectives on the map and contesting these is what causes most of the fights to break out. The early game neutral objectives are buffs (which give a time-limited advantage to one champion) located in both sides of the jungle, plus the rift herald and dragon located in the river. In the late game, the Baron and Elder Drake are the main objectives which teams look to secure in order to finish the game as both of these give a whole team buff. 
  </p>
  <h4>Twisted treeline</h4>
  <p>
    The set up and aim is the same as on Summoner's rift, however now teams consists of 3 players and there are only two lanes with a jungle between. Games on this map are conisderably shorter however few players play on this map in comparison due to lack of support in the professional scene. 
  </p>
  <h4>Howling Abyss</h4>
  <p>
    This mode is very different as it is purely a casual mode (never ranked). It consists of a single lane and there are 5 players on each team. It is designed to encourage team fighting throughout as there are no neutral objectives and noone can return to base to buy items unless they die. As a result it is a very fast paced game which normally only lasts 20 minutes as opposed to a ranked summoner's rift game which can last anywhere from 15minutes (unanimous surrender) to over an hour in some cases, with the average being 40 minutes.
